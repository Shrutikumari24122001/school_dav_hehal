                The purpose of the teachers of our school is not to provide education only for learning from books and passing some 
                examinations.In addition to book learning,teaches motivate students to find a well  balanced a properly developed mind 
                and healthy body such that students will turn into a worthy member of society.
                According to the teachers,education is like a lamp in a dark place.Just as the approach of a lamp the accumulated darkness
                of the house is dispelled in a moment,similarly,the darkness of ignorance is driven away by true educatin.A man becomes 
                conscious of his powers and responsibilities at the same time.
